Your tomorrows are as bright   
as you want to make them.   
There is no reason to carry   
the darkness of the past  
with you into today.  
Today is a wonderful new experience，  
full of every possibility to make  
your life exactly what you want it to be.  
Today is the beginning of new happiness,  
new directions and new relationships.  
Today is the day to remind yourself  
that you posses the power  
and strength you need  
to bring contentment, love and joy into your life.  
Today is the day to understand yourself  
and to give yourself the love  
and the patience that you need.   
Today is the day to move forward  
towards your bright tomorrow.  
  
你的明天充满阳光，  
如你心中所想。  
你没有理由，  
把昨天的黑暗，  
带到今天。  
今天是美妙的全新体验，  
有那么多种可能，  
使你的生活如你所愿。  
今天开始有新的幸福，  
新的方向和新的伙伴。  
今天你要提醒自己，  
你有足够的能力和力量，  
把满意、爱情和欢乐带进你的生活。  
今天你要了解自己，  
给自己足够的爱心和耐心。  
今天你会勇往直前。
